          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <h2>Visitor data</h2>
            <p>Rxivist.org does not collect any information about its users that is not incidentally captured by server access logs.
            <p>We do use Google Analytics (with all demographic collection features disabled) to better understand how visitors use our site. Google has published details of <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">how they use this data</a> if you would like to review details of their privacy and compliance measures.
            <p>Newsletter sign-ups are stored by MailChimp and are not shared with any outside organizations.

          <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Rxivist builds profiles of papers and authors using only content pulled directly from the preprint servers. If we have erroneously interpreted the data, or have problematically outdated information about a paper or author, please contact Richard Abdill at <strong>rxivist@umn.edu</strong>.
